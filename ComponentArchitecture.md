## Component based architecture

Component based architectures is the new paradigm for frontend development. The idea is to build autonomous pieces with clearly defined responsibilities and which might even be reusable across multiple applications. Components are 1st class citizens in Angular. 

Angular's architecture is built on components. The template, data, and logic are all contained inside a Component in an Angular application. There may be one or more components in an Angular application. 

Consider the Product Review System as an example. Product List, Product Description, and Product Rating may all be included on a single page. 

Angular’s component-based architecture has revolutionized how we build dynamic and responsive web applications. A well-structured component architecture is essential for creating maintainable, scalable, and robust applications.


## Best practices for organizing Angular Components

1. <b>Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)</b>: Each Angular component should have a single responsibility, meaning it should focus on one aspect of the user interface. This makes the codebase more readable, maintainable, and easier to debug. For example, separate components for header, sidebar, and main content in a dashboard application.

2. <b>Hierarchical Component Structure</b>: Follow a hierarchical structure by dividing your UI into smaller components that represent individual elements. This approach encourages reusability and encapsulation. Parent components can manage the state and communication between child components.

3. <b>Smart and Dumb Components</b>: Differentiate between smart (container) components and dumb (presentational) components. Smart components handle business logic, state management, and API interactions, while dumb components focus solely on rendering the UI based on input data.

4. <b>Reusable UI Components</b>: Identify UI elements that are used across multiple parts of your application and create reusable components for them. Examples include buttons, input fields, and modals. This not only promotes consistency but also reduces duplication of code.

5. <b>Angular Modules</b>: Leverage Angular modules to group related components, services, and other artifacts. Modules help with lazy loading, code organization, and managing dependencies. Consider breaking down your app into feature modules for better maintainability.

6. <b>Component Communication</b>: Use input and output properties to establish communication between parent and child components. When components need to communicate upwards or across the component tree, services and shared state management libraries like NgRx can be valuable.

7. <b>Directory Structure</b>: Adopt a well-organized directory structure that reflects your component hierarchy. Group related components, templates, styles, and tests in dedicated folders. This structure makes it easier to navigate and locate files.

8. <b>CSS Encapsulation</b>: Leverage Angular’s View Encapsulation to encapsulate component-specific styles and prevent them from affecting other parts of the application. However, be mindful of global styles that might override encapsulated styles.

9. <b>Lazy Loading</b>: Implement lazy loading to load modules and components on demand. This improves initial load times and enhances the overall user experience. Lazy loading is particularly useful for large applications with multiple routes.

10. <b>Testing Components</b>: Prioritize unit testing for components to ensure they function as expected. Use Angular’s TestBed to create a testing environment and write tests for different scenarios and edge cases.
