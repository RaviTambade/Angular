# Angular 18: Top features and updates


Angular, the popular web application framework developed by Google, continues to evolve. With the release of Angular 18 on May 22, developers have much to look forward to. Angular 18 introduces a range of features and improvements aimed at enhancing performance, developer experience, and overall robustness. In this blog, we will delve into why Angular 18 matters, highlighting its top 20+ features and updates.

## Why Angular 18 matters
Angular has consistently been a framework of choice for building robust, scalable, and maintainable web applications. Each new version of Angular brings enhancements that address existing pain points and introduces innovative features that align with modern web development practices. Angular 18 is no exception. It promises to improve developer productivity, application performance and user experience.


## Key features and updates in Angular 18

1. Enhanced reactivity model
Angular 18 introduces an enhanced reactivity model that simplifies state management and data flow within applications. This new model is more intuitive, reducing boilerplate code and making it easier to manage complex state interactions. It also improves performance by optimizing change detection mechanisms.

2. Standalone components
One of the most anticipated features in Angular 18 is the introduction of standalone components. This allows developers to create components that do not rely on Angular modules. It makes them more modular and easier to reuse across different parts of an application or across different projects. Standalone components can significantly reduce the overhead associated with module management.

3. Improved build performance
Build performance has always been a critical aspect of Angular’s development workflow. Angular 18 includes a range of optimizations that reduce build times, particularly for large projects. Improvements in the Angular CLI, along with better caching mechanisms and incremental compilation, contribute to faster builds and more efficient development cycles.

4. Advanced template type checking
This improvement helps developers catch errors early in the development process, reduce debugging time and increase code reliability. The advanced type checking now supports more complex type scenarios, making Angular applications safer and more predictable.

5. ESM (ECMAScript Module) support
Angular 18 fully embraces ECMAScript Modules (ESM), aligning with modern JavaScript standards. ESM support ensures better compatibility with other modern libraries and tools, thus leading to more efficient code splitting and loading. This results in faster initial load times and a smoother user experience.

6. Component-level state management
State management in Angular has been traditionally handled using services and global state libraries like NgRx. With Angular 18, developers have the option to manage the state at the component level more effectively. This feature simplifies state management for small to medium-sized applications, making it easier to reason about state changes and interactions within individual components.

```
@Component({
  selector: 'app-counter',
  template: `
    <button (click)="increment()">Increment</button>
    <p>Count: {{ count }}</p>
  `,
})
@ComponentState()
export class CounterComponent {
  count = 0;

  increment() {
    this.count++;
  }
}
```

7. Improved developer tooling
Angular 18 comes with significant improvements to developer tooling, including enhanced support in Angular DevTools. These updates provide better insights into application performance, dependency management, and state changes. The improved tooling makes it easier for developers to debug and optimize their applications.

8. Enhanced angular material and CDK
The Angular Material library and Component Dev Kit (CDK) have received updates to align with Angular 18’s new features. These updates include new components, improved accessibility features, and performance optimizations. The CDK enhancements make it easier to create custom components with advanced interactions and behaviors.

9. Server-side rendering (SSR) enhancements
Server-Side rendering in Angular 18 has been optimized for better performance and ease of integration. These enhancements include improved pre-rendering capabilities, faster server-side hydration, and better support for Angular Universal. SSR improvements help in reducing Time to Interactive (TTI) and improving the overall user experience, especially on slower networks.

10. Better internationalization (i18n) support
Internationalization support in Angular 18 has been refined to make it easier to localize applications. New APIs and tooling improvements streamline the process of translating and managing different language versions of an application. This is particularly beneficial for developers working on applications targeted at a global audience.

11. Accessibility improvements
Accessibility continues to be a priority in Angular 18, with several enhancements aimed at making applications more accessible out of the box. New directives and components are introduced to ensure better compliance with accessibility standards, making it easier for developers to create inclusive web applications.

12. Default content in ng-content
Angular 18 allows default content within the ng-content tag. It enhances component flexibility and provides fallback content when no projection is provided.

13. Route redirects with functions
Angular 18 introduces a new feature that allows developers to manage redirects using functions instead of plain strings. This flexibility enhances routing capabilities. To leverage these new features effectively, consider partnering with a professional Angular development company to enhance your project’s capabilities.

```

const routes: Routes = [
  { path: 'page1', redirectTo: (url) => '/page2', pathMatch: 'full' }
];
```
The function can return either a string or an UrlTree, which captures URL information.



14. New RedirectCommand class
Angular 18 introduces the RedirectCommand class to manage NavigationExtras. Developers can use this class to handle complex navigation patterns with Guards and Resolvers.

```


const route: Route = {
  path: 'page1',
  component: PageComponent,
  canActivate: [
    () => {
      const router: Router = inject(Router);
      const urlTree: UrlTree = router.parseUrl('./page2');
      return new RedirectCommand(urlTree, { skipLocationChange: true });
    },
  ],
};




```

15. Zoneless applications
Angular aims to incorporate signals into applications without relying on zone.js. This optimization improves performance and navigation behavior.


16. TypeScript 4.7 support
Angular 18 includes support for TypeScript 4.7, allowing developers to leverage the latest TypeScript features and improvements. These features include:

-- Template literal types: Give developers the ability to precisely define template types and detect errors at an early stage.
-- Better readonly support: Offers a safer and more reliable method of using the readonly keyword.
-- New import types: Promote more organization and modularity in the code.


17. Improved performance with Ivy
Ivy, Angular’s new rendering engine, continues to enhance performance and bundle size. Its enhanced tree shaking capabilities reduce the bundle size by removing unused code, leading to smaller production bundles and faster load times. These optimizations will result in:

Faster startup times
Smaller bundle sizes
Better overall performance
18. Enhanced CLI commands
Angular CLI commands receive updates for a better developer experience. New commands include ng generate component with automatic routing setup and ng lint with improved rule configuration.

19. WebAssembly support
Angular 18 allows developers to use WebAssembly modules directly in components, opening up possibilities for high-performance computations and integrations with existing WebAssembly libraries.

20. Improved AOT compilation
Ahead-of-Time (AOT) compilation gets further optimizations, resulting in faster startup times. Smaller generated code and improved performance are notable benefits.


### Summary
Angular 18 represents a significant step forward in the evolution of this powerful web application framework. With its enhanced reactivity model, standalone components, improved build performance, advanced template type checking, and full ESM support, Angular 18 offers a robust set of tools and features that cater to modern web development needs.

For developers, the improvements in developer tooling, server-side rendering, internationalization, and accessibility support mean that creating high-quality, performant, and inclusive applications is more achievable than ever. Angular 18 not only addresses existing challenges but also sets the stage for future innovations in web development.
