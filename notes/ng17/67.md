### **1. What is `angular.json`?**

* It’s the **main configuration file** for an Angular workspace/project.
* Angular CLI (`ng build`, `ng serve`, `ng test`, etc.) **reads this file** to know how to **build, serve, and test your app**.
* Think of it as the **blueprint for the Angular CLI**.


### **2. What `angular.json` contains**

`angular.json` defines **everything about your project structure, builds, and environments**. Some important sections:

#### **a) Projects**

```json
"projects": {
  "my-app": { ... }
}
```

* Lists all apps and libraries in your workspace.
* Each project can have its **own configuration**.



#### **b) Architect / Targets**

```json
"architect": {
  "build": { ... },
  "serve": { ... },
  "test": { ... },
  "lint": { ... }
}
```

* Defines **tasks you can run** with Angular CLI commands.

  * `build` → How to compile your app
  * `serve` → Dev server configuration
  * `test` → Unit test setup
  * `lint` → Linting rules

* Inside each, you define **options**, like input files, output paths, styles, scripts, and optimization settings.



#### **c) Build options**

* **Output path**: Where the compiled files go (`dist/`)
* **Index file**: The main HTML file (`index.html`)
* **Main file**: Entry point (`main.ts`)
* **Polyfills**: Files needed for older browsers
* **Styles & scripts**: Global CSS/JS included in the app
* **Optimization & sourcemaps**: Production settings

Example snippet:

```json
"build": {
  "builder": "@angular-devkit/build-angular:browser",
  "options": {
    "outputPath": "dist/my-app",
    "index": "src/index.html",
    "main": "src/main.ts",
    "polyfills": "src/polyfills.ts",
    "tsConfig": "tsconfig.app.json",
    "assets": ["src/favicon.ico", "src/assets"],
    "styles": ["src/styles.css"],
    "scripts": []
  }
}
```


#### **d) File replacements**

* Used for **environment-specific builds**
* Example: Replace `environment.ts` with `environment.prod.ts` for production builds.



#### **e) Default project**

```json
"defaultProject": "my-app"
```

* Tells Angular CLI which project to build/run if you have multiple projects in a workspace.



### **3. Analogy**

Think of `angular.json` as a **control panel** for Angular CLI:

* It tells **where the app lives** (source files, assets, styles)
* It tells **how to build it** (compiler options, production vs dev)
* It tells **how to serve it** (port, dev server options)
* It tells **how to test and lint**

Without `angular.json`, Angular CLI wouldn’t know how to **run or build your app**.


### ✅ **Key points**

* Angular CLI depends on it entirely.
* Contains **project structure, build options, environment configurations, scripts, styles, and more**.
* Helps manage **multi-project workspaces** easily.
